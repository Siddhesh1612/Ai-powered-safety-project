# 🚨 AI-Powered Campus Incident & Safety Alert System

A privacy-first, real-time safety platform for campuses that enables anonymous incident reporting, one-tap SOS alerts, and AI-driven risk analysis to improve emergency response and proactively identify unsafe zones.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Campus incidents often go unreported due to fear of identification, slow response mechanisms, and fragmented communication channels. Existing systems are mostly manual, reactive, and lack real-time intelligence, resulting in delayed intervention and poor situational awareness for authorities.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview
This system provides a unified, AI-enabled safety ecosystem that allows students to report incidents anonymously while enabling campus authorities to monitor, analyze, and respond to incidents in real time through an intelligent dashboard.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Anonymous Incident Reporting** – No login or personal data required  
- **One-Tap SOS Alerts** – Instant high-priority emergency reporting  
- **Real-Time Location Tracking** – Faster and more accurate response  
- **AI-Based Risk Analysis** – Identifies hotspots and recurring patterns  
- **Safety Heatmap Dashboard** – Live visualization of unsafe zones  
- **Intelligent Alert Routing** – Automatically notifies the right authority  
- **Privacy-First Design** – Security without compromising anonymity  

---

## 🤖 AI & Intelligence Layer
The system uses lightweight, explainable AI logic to:
- Cluster incidents by location and type  
- Generate risk scores for campus zones  
- Detect recurring safety patterns  
- Predict high-risk time windows  

This ensures proactive safety management instead of reactive reporting.
